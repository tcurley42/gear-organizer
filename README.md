# Sinatra Final Project - Gear Rack

This project allows friends to create accounts and list the gear they have for
various sports (skiing, biking, camping, etc.). By being able to maintain their
inventory via an application, they can keep track of everything they have. They
will also be able to view their friends' gear to see if they have something they
could borrow.

## Running the Application

To run the application locally, pull the project, run `bundle install` and then `shotgun`. The application should be available at http://localhost:9393/
